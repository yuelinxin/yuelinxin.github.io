                        Optron: Better Medical Image Registration via Optimizing in the Loop
                    </a>
                </h3>
                <span>
                    A general training architecture that combines the advantages of deep-learning-based
                    methods and optimization-based methods to achieve better performance. Optron provides 
                    pseudo supervision to the model by optimizing the model's output in the loop, which 
                    allows the model to learn from the optimization process and improve its performance.

                <span>
                    A novel temporal segmentation algorithm used in real-time video stream 
                    interpretation. It works together with CNN models to improve the model's 
                    ability to handle temporal data by introducing the temporal concept of a 
                    "scene", such that CNNs can be used to interpret videos in a whole new way.

                    The HSAOIS is an object detection
                    system that is designed and fine tuned based on YOLOv5 to detect defects 
                    on computer motherboards. We made great improvements on top of what YOLOv5 
                    already provides, by modifying the model's backbone, and introducing the 
                    2SDS algorithm, we were able to increase the inference speed by 25% without 
                    losing accuracy.
